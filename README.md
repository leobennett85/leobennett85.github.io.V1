## Abstract for Taxi Stats Accumulator

---

The taxi accumulator is a tool to aid in recording accumulated jobs and their statistics. Each job will take input, calculate totals and provide a summary of the job. At the end of a job when all information is submitted this will accumulate into a running total. This will make end of day recording easier and give the driver a live total and recording of runs.
